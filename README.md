<img width="625" alt="badbank" src="https://github.com/jtpearson95/badbank/assets/130475233/bc22fb30-ae65-4142-bc98-ffb6f12142a1">

This is a mock-up of a simple banking application. It's an introduction to full stack development. You can create an account, login, and access your balance. It has options to deposit and withdraw money.

It has a front end and a back end. The front end uses React, and there is an Express server and a MongoDB database. In the future, I plan on re-factoring and including authentication with Firebase to round out the project.
The reasons why this project exists, including the answers to pertinent questions such as whom does it help, why did you build it, and what business or personal problem does it solve.

# Installation Guidelines:
Download the files with git clone and then run npm install to read the package.json file and download the necessary Node.js modules. From there, you can run the databse through a docker container and run the Express server. You can connect to a GUI like MongoDB Compass to view the data visually. 

# Technology Used:
MongoDB, Express, React, Node
